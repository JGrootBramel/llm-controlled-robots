- How to control the limo cobot with an LLM

### Problems
Limo cobot sim is only awailable for ROS1, gazebo classic, the ROS1 compatible version is End of Life (EOL). Possible solutions are:

1. Using Gazebo Classic and ROS1. Further reading: [Simulation in ROS1 and Gazebo Classic.md](Simulation%20in%20ROS1%20and%20Gazebo%20Classic.md)
2. Use ROS1 sim and bridge to ROS2
3. Prot the ROS1 sim to ROS2 humble and Gazebo Fortress 

### Open Questions
- The simulation file for the Limo Cobot is awailable in ROS 1. Is there a Limo Cobot sim in ROS 2? 
- Can we use ROS 1 Noetic and do the project in ROS 1?
